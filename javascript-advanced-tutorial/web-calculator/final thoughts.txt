1) You can add the elements in the class, and then modify the elements within the class
2) You can set the elements to be private, and when you declare the private variables, you do not neeed to declare anything below it
3) you can actually split the numbers everytime, then check if the decimal place exist. if exist, then you add, if not, then
dont add, and this can be done by using the .
4) to clean the code, you could pass the digit into a set function, and you then process the digit adding in the display in set function
5) when checking for null value from parameters, do parameter?.test
6) i realized that my way of doing is that, i keep repeating the same implementation of certain functions for exmaple,
setting the dataset in elements, setting the display value in the elements
7) instead of resetting the primary and secondary display over and over again, with a buunch of implementation, call the clear
function that clears the display, and just set the answer in it
and within the clear function, set the value with theh value, and the logic for setting the value in the display is implemented
within the set function
